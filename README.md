### 1.  Disable windows real time protection (it will turn back on automatically after a short time) as it will block downloading vanillafixes and superwow.

### 2.  While you have windows security open, add a folder exclusion for your base turtle wow folder (where WoW.exe is) so that it doesn't remove vanillafixes/superwow later on out of nowhere.
<hr>

### 3.  Download the latest vanilla fixes (>= version 1.4) if you don't already have it from here https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes/releases and place in your TWow folder next to WoW.exe.  You may need to add `d3d9.enableDialogMode = True` to your dxvk.conf file if you are getting black screens when alt-tabbing or switching windows.
<hr>

### 4.  Download the latest SuperWoW dll from here https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/releases/tag/Release and place in your TWow folder next to WoW.exe.  You only need the dll you don't need the launcher.
<b>Make sure you have visual studio 2017 redistributable installed!  A lot of games require this so there's a good chance you already do.  32 bit download: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe <b/>
<hr>

### 5.  Download the latest SuperWoW api addon from here https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI and place in Interface/Addons making sure to remove the "-master" suffix appended by github.  
In the minimap icon this adds you can configure the behavior for the following:
- autoloot
- clickthrough
- background sound
- sound cap
- fov
- selection style
<hr>

### 6.  (Optional) If you want VanillaTweaks as well:
- Download tweaks here https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks?tab=readme-ov-file#current-patches and place in your TWow folder next to WoW.exe
- Copy + paste `WoW.exe` so you have a backup of it
- Drag `WoW.exe` on top of `vanilla_tweaks.exe` or run `./vanilla-tweaks WoW.exe` from the command line in the directory containing `WoW.exe` and `vanilla-tweaks.exe`.  If you want to specify specific options like increasing nameplate range you have to use the command line.  See https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage for examples
- Rename either `WoW_tweaked` to `WoW` or `WoW_tweaked.exe` to `WoW.exe` depending on whether you have "Show file extensions" turned on in Windows.  Be careful not to accidentally make the filename `WoW.exe.exe` if you don't have "Show file extensions" turned on in windows.
<hr>

### 7.  (Optional) If you want to see improved enemy castbars pick ONE of these options:
<b>Don't use both of these together.</b>
#### Option 1 PFUI
Download the latest PFUI from here https://github.com/shagu/pfUI and place in Interface/Addons making sure to remove the "-master" suffix appended by github.
#### Option 2 SuperAPI_Castlib
Download the latest SuperWoW castlib addon from here https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI_Castlib and place in Interface/Addons making sure to remove the "-master" suffix appended by github.
<hr>

### 8.  If using the TWOW launcher use that to start the game.  Otherwise launch VanillaFixes.exe to start the game.  The first time it should pop up a dialog saying which dlls it is loading and SuperWoW should be one of them.
<hr>

### 9.  In game open up a macro and if you have 512 allowed characters Superwow is working
<hr>

### 10.  (Optional) Ignore this if already did this when installing SuperAPI.  If you were using vanillatweaks for sounds while the game is in the background, run `/run SetCVar("BackgroundSound", "1")` to reenable that.  Can also do `/run SetCVar("UncapSounds", "1");SetCVar("SoundMaxHardwareChannels", "64");SetCVar("SoundSoftwareChannels", "64");` to enable the game to play more simultaneous sounds.

### 11. If you are getting this error launching
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00807ba1-53a3-4485-be76-a83c866bc48b)

On Windows: Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings. Under Performance, click Settings, then the Data Execution Prevention tab.

Select Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select, and add WoW.exe to the list. (Remember to remove this later if it doesnâ€™t help you.)

This can also be caused by not having any Visual c++ redistributables installed, try installing using this link:

32 bit x86: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe (probably just need this one)

64 bit x64:https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
